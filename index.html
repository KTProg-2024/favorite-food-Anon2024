          <p id="favorite">Porkchop is currently my favorite food. Mainly because I can cook it very well and I have it every once in a while. Plus it also tastes good. My mom got me to cook porkchop more because she could actually eat it. Over time I became better and better at cooking it as I added more and more ingrediants to my personal recipe.</p>

              <h3>Entree</h3>
              <p>Steak used to be my favorite food because of the same reasons I like porkchops. But lately I've been cooking Porkchops more because my mom can actually eat it. But as I've improved at cooking Porkchops, I've gotten severely worse at cooking steak. I'll still order it at restaurants, but I'm not as good at cooking it as I was before.</p>

                  <h3>Side dish</h3>
                  <p>I like French fries because of how many scenarios they can be used in. If I was looking for a quick tasty snack, I can just fry up some fries. I wanted something to go along my main dish, I would order fries. But how fries turn out when I cook them is random. They can either be very soggy, very over-cooked, and/or super salty.</p>

                      <h3>Entree/side dish</h3>
                      <p>Shrimp is also very versitile when it comes to how they can be implemented into dishes. They can be covered in flour and deep-fired. They can be mixed in with stir fried noodles to make stir fry noodles with a topping of shrimp. Shrimp can be put into many stews and soups. They can be served hot or cold and they will still taste good.</p>

                          <h3>Snack</h3>
                          <p>I really like oysters. Out of all the shellfish I eat, Oysters come out on top. Especially when it's raw and lemon juice is put on them. Unfortunately, I eat them very rarely. The only restaurant I can think of that serves oysters the way I like them is pretty far and we only go there every once in a while. But now because of Covid, that restaurant doesn't serve them anymore.</p>
